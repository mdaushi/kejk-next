            <description><![CDATA[The ultimate design companion is just around the corner]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[These days, there’s always a constant influx of new things to learn as a designer. We had the great “should designers code” debate; we also had accessible 3D crop up with new Figma-like tools such as [Spline](https://spline.design/) to learn; we had NFTs where you needed to grasp the concept of tokens and fungibility; and finally we have AI, where you need to learn how to integrate it into your workflow to avoid “[losing your job](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-jobs-economy)”.

Granted, no, you don’t have to actually learn all these tools or ways of working. But as Designers and Developers, we’re often curious by nature and keen to be on the bleeding edge of technologies. Naturally that means we want to try things out, but importantly we also sometimes have to because our company (or companies we want to work for) expect us to.

Recently there’s been a lot of discussion about how AI could finally be after our [design](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/yes-ai-will-replace-designers-9d90c6e34502) or [development](https://medium.com/geekculture/will-ai-replace-programmers-fb6fcfd70b37) jobs. Like always with AI, it’s seen as an inevitability and that maybe we need to start looking for new things to be good at. [Kyle Lambert](https://indieweb.social/@kylelambert) wrote a [great piece](https://www.imkylelambert.com/articles/will-ai-take-my-design-job) on this recently. 

In reality, yes, AI may soon get good enough to do some of the tasks of a designer. But critically, it’s still very much at the early stage where it simply copies things from the internet and attempts to sometimes create something slightly new, but that normally always has flaws.

The more I’ve been playing with Chat-GPT which is [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)’s playground for its [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) AI model, the more I’ve gotten interested in treating it more like a companion than a threat. More like a pair designer or pair developer, helping me get around thorny problems or simply just kick of a project.

> Instead of assuming AI will take our jobs, we can assume it’ll become the best pair designer/developer to help us get started.

I recently spent some time using it as a copywriting assistant when designing mocks.

I can ask it a quick phrase like “Write a headline that helps explain the importance of investing compared with saving into an interest-bearing account over the long term” which gives me the response “Investing for the Future: A Look at How Smart Investing Beats Out Saving for Retirement”. Not bad really!

![Image of the first copy request and answer inside the PomptAI interface](https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/77d1b720-9ee7-11ed-aca2-37db769eb59f-AEB814E6-2BB5-4EAE-908F-2DFAA9920AF5.jpeg)

What about “Write three bullet points for an app that helps explain the importance of investing compared with saving into an interest-bearing account over the long term” instead? This gives me:

*   Investing in the stock market, mutual funds or other types of investments can result in higher returns than the interest rate on a traditional savings account.
    
*   Investing allows your money to grow faster over the long term, allowing you to take advantage of compound interest.
    
*   Investing allows you to diversify your portfolio and protect against market fluctuations, providing valuable protection for your savings.
    

![Image of the second copy request and answer inside the PomptAI interface](https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/77dcb3a0-9ee7-11ed-aca2-37db769eb59f-BEC501B5-CCA8-4722-B465-5E874953C3A7.jpeg)

Also really not bad at all. And if anything, a helpful jumping off point to refine based on our copywriting style.

AI pair design will also provide a great mechanism for fast iterations on an idea. Think of it as the ultimate Crazy 8’s companion. Feed it the initial concept and let it go wild for you. These tools will also be able to quickly evaluate hundreds of design solutions and narrow them down as quickly as possible. This means that the design process can be completed much faster than if it were done by humans. Equally, they can also be programmed to automatically adjust parameters and learn from their mistakes, allowing them to continuously improve the design and produce more reliable results with added accuracy.

But this is more a future thinking concept when tools powered by [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) or other new AI models improve. Right now, the image generation is incredible but it doesn’t really hit the mark for consistently good app ideas, it’s much more useful for fantasy images.

[Diagram](https://diagram.com/) have started to play with some interesting ideas here via their [Magician](https://magician.design/) plugin for Figma. As a way to generate quick icon iterations, UI and marketing copy or image ideas, it’s a fantastic tool to speed up your workflow. But it can’t replace an amazing icon designer, illustrator or copywriter right now.

Ultimately we’ll still need the human in the loop to ensure designs connect well with the people who’ll interact with them. It’s naive to think AI will be capable of human-level empathy any time soon or to make real, “conscious” decisions off the back of internal feedback. But one day we’ll likely get there.

I think we’ll see an entire industry boom around the design of great prompts soon too. Imagine feeding an AI with the perfect prompt to generate amazing outputs. We’re seeing this happen in the form of shared prompt spreadsheets or other [websites](https://prompts.chat/), but there’ll likely be entire businesses that help you generate great prompts that generate great outputs. Then, eventually, we won’t need those anymore and we’ll just skip straight to great outputs from any prompt.

I think it’ll be important for us to embrace this new reality. Eventually every product will be powered in some way by AI, some are even already betting on it as [part of their product strategy](https://www.notion.so/product/ai). So if you’ve not tried out GPT-3 and want to give it a go on iOS or macOS then you can [try out an app](https://testflight.apple.com/join/mXfEcgfv) I built for myself via TestFlight. It’s a simple native companion that uses OpenAIs API to provide responses based on text input. You can read more about [here](https://kejk.tech/prompt-ai).

I encourage you as a designer to embrace it to shortcut the more tricky part of mocking designs—coming up with fake but realistic copy—and let me know if PromptAI proves useful. As a developer, I’d encourage you to play with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) again if you’ve not in a while, it’s incredible and powered by Codex from OpenAI (which you can also use in PromptAI’s Code tab).

            <description><![CDATA[Lots of conversations, tasks, research and reading later]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When on the outside looking in during an interview process, you can learn a lot about a company. By reading the docs they send you, looking for Glassdoor reviews or by asking questions at interview stage. But until you’re actually there, you don’t know if you made the right choice. 

DuckDuckGo runs very differently to places I’ve worked before, but the way it runs is incredibly exciting and offers a whole host of opportunities to do your best work. 

Below are the top five things I’ve noticed so far. 

## 1. Levels don’t matter, so don’t bring them up

We have a rule internally that we don’t share our level anywhere except in an external public forum (for example, LinkedIn) and that’s only if we want to. 

By removing our levels from the conversation, the best ideas and best opportunities rise to the top no matter where they came from.

This means that meetings involving C-suite, VP’s and others don’t lead to top down solutions. They create open spaces for discussion. Yes it’s possible to find out people’s level (obviously you’ll know the C-suite) but this approach is disarming and provides space for everyone to have maximum impact.

We still have assigned people who lead specific objectives, but they’re just the directly responsible individual, not necessarily the final decision maker. This approach opens the floor for anyone at any level to have equal or outsized impact, but with ownership falling on the lead for that objective as a point of last resort.

## 2. Salaries are level dependent, not role dependent

It doesn’t matter what you do, whether it’s design, development, data science, social media etc. What you earn is relative to your level. So there’s no fighting over why one team are paid more than another. We all earn the same, because our value to the business is the same. Again, this has a disarming effect, allowing us to focus on doing our best work and not on whether we’re earning the same as the other people in the virtual room we’re in.

This also means it’s really easy to see a path forwards from where you are and to understand what the potential is for levels and roles as they’re globally the same.

Inline with point 1, the fact that all roles earn equal salaries helps with preventing an attitude of passing blame or feeling something is “above your pay-grade” because someone else in the room is "probably" earning more than you.

## 3. We write everything, and I mean everything, down

Writing everything down makes it possible for anyone to go back and see why a decision was made, even if that decision was made in 2015… it’s immense and quite overwhelming to begin with, but makes all the difference as a newbie to the company.

This also means that onboarding is fully self-directed (much like a lot of the work we do here), so it’s possible to onboard in your own time and it doesn’t take people out of their responsibilities to be constantly trying to help you along (although they will if you ask!).

We also ensure that project conversations are captured for all to see and discover. We use Mattermost (an open source Slack alternative) for synchronous text conversations, but Mattermost automatically clears after a week so that we're encouraged to leverage Asana for project conversations.

## 4. Fully remote work creates better work/life boundaries

In our modern world, we have lots to do and the typical 9-5 office model restricts this. Fully remote, and predominantly asynchronous work, enables better work/life balance by allowing you to get your work done when it suits you. 

Those times can shift day to day. If you’ve got an appointment, no need to take half a day off, just go to it and make up the time later or when it suits you. As long as you deliver, it doesn’t matter when you did it or how long it actually took to complete. No-one is watching to see how long you've been online or when you last sent a message.

Obviously the flip side of this is that it can be possible to work different hours to your significant other in order to meet with overseas colleagues and this may create complexity with home routines. It’s important to be able to say no to meetings (and we encourage this!) if they’ll interfere with your personal life regularly.

Most importantly, on Wednesdays and Thursdays we have a rule that no recurring meetings take place. This gives space for deep work and is followed to the letter company-wide without question. Sporadic meetings can take place on these days, but they're not commonplace.

## 5. Anyone can take on any project at any time

You can propose a new project idea or pick up anything in the pool of ideas at any time. There’s no restrictions around a person being tied to one siloed product area. If I want to work on the Mac browser for a project cycle and then shift to the Extension, Search, Mobile apps etc., then I can. 

This flexibility creates an almost agency-like model but tied to a single vision. This also prevents possible boredom or burnout from working on a single part of a product relentlessly.

## Trust matters

Overall, the most important lesson in all of this comes down to trust. In every role I've looked for, and every interview conversation I've had, I've always prioritised asking about trust within the organisation. It's vital to me that I'm given the space and trust to do my best work. I don't want to be micromanaged, especially not at this stage in my career. 

Based on the above observations and many conversations, it's ultimately the most critical part of what makes the company work. Without implicit trust in everything and everyone, the company would simply cease to function at the speed, with the level of quality of polish, that it currently does. 

Our growth has been very intentional, relative to other tech companies out there, our team is still small and nimble. But this means trust is essential and the rewards are there for all to see and benefit from.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[## Building for fun, by solving problems you face

I've always been a bit of a nightmare when it comes to trying to solve problems for myself. I can't help myself, I just end up spending time tinkering to try and speed up my workflow and improve the outcomes of what I'm doing for future me.

Where it becomes a nightmare is when I spend more time on trying to solve the problem than I do actually taking advantage of the solution…

I've always felt that creating stuff for yourself is the best way to learn a new technology or how something works. Tutorials in a lot of ways are great, but you'll retain the info much better _and_ keep coming back to learn more about it, if what you build benefits you personally and solves a real problem you regularly face.

Let's face it, whilst you can learn things from building yet another to-do list app, is that something you really need (he writes, via his home-grown markdown editor he didn’t need to make). 

I started tinkering with my personal website (from `HTML` and `CSS` to `Vue` and then `React`), then got into hacking around Figma plugins to make designing easier, which then got me into writing SwiftUI apps to improve the rest of my workflows. But I also ultimately want to better understand any technology I’m interested in designing for. I’ve never felt I can design to the best of my ability unless I’m able to understand how the sausage is made. 

But more than that, tinkering and building things for myself makes my life easier and keeps me deeply interested in the evolution of design and technology. It keeps me at the forefront of aspects of it and helps to ensure I don’t design for ideas that were 5-years-ago-good.

The biggest thing I’ve found is to be logical, take your time and step up slowly from simple to complex. My first app was just a basic pixel to rem calculator, then it could pass data between views via AppStorage, then I expanded to add other calculators, then adding widgets, and now it stores saved calculations in Core Data so it has persistence between restarts etc.

Recently I’ve been working on a series of micro apps that interface with the Cosmic API (my headless CMS of choice and also a team I work with). These little utilities allow me to extend the power of my CMS into native apps for my phone, iPad and Mac. They fundamentally make my life easier, but, they’re not essential. They’re also not release-worthy. And that’s okay, because they help me solve specific problems I have and allow me to more deeply understand the technology that interacts with the API, and also even better understand the API itself. This means, as the Design Lead, I can better understand what our end customers might also be trying to do with our API and therefore make suggestions and improvements to the API based on roadblocks I faced.

One example of this, was adding in the ability to edit content that was in a ‘draft’ state via the API itself rather than just within the web app. This was because I had blogs in draft on my Cosmic Go app that I wanted to tweak before I published. Helpful for me, but also, I couldn’t have been the only person needing this. I also had the backchannel to fix it and the visibility of the issue thanks to my tinkering. 

In terms of those micro-apps; I’ve spent some time building an app that [decodes JSON](https://www.kejk.tech/cosmic-go) from my Cosmic CMS to show me my bookmarks, blogs, features and some key stats—as well as letting me edit them too! I’ve built a simple media uploader that returns a Cosmic link to your clipboard, an app to write this very blog post in a super simple markdown editor that saves to iCloud using native plaintext files, and even an app [powered by](https://www.kejk.tech/prompt-ai) GPT-3 to interface with ChatGPT, Codex and DALL-E.

![Cosmic Writer on macOS](https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/7c3afb50-a3e2-11ed-8d58-2bb0c90a324a-Cosmic-Writer.jpg)

If you use iOS or macOS and are interested in learning, I’d recommend you try SwiftUI, with live previews and a very declarative approach, it often feels like designing in code. It’s also super quick to pick up and build easy things. Check out Paul Hudson’s [tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuoeXyslFTuaZtX7xSYbWz3TR0Vpz39gK) series’, they’re amazing and save me ages of hunting around. Also check out this post by Stammy on [getting started with SwiftUI](https://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-with-swiftui/) as a Designer. Stammy also [wrote about building for yourself](https://paulstamatiou.com/building/) a couple of years back. 

If you want to check out some great examples of people with digital playgrounds, check out [Rauno Freiburg](https://rauno.me/craft) for example, to see some neat stuff. Or [Julius Koroll](https://www.itsjuko.com/playground) for more design-specific playing around. And finally, [Adrian Mato](https://mastodon.design/@adrianmg/109794115937273202) has been playing around with building a game recently!]]></content:encoded>
